[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  Cool. However, our network is spread across America or Black Jesuit alumni. It
[00:08.000 --> 00:16.920]  would help for engagement continuously if there were, if it were to kind of
[00:16.920 --> 00:22.480]  like establish like chapters, maybe city chapters because it's already
[00:22.480 --> 00:27.440]  everything. So we had Jesuit Black alumni and Atlanta hosting and having certain
[00:27.440 --> 00:33.280]  events. But we had Jesuit alumni in Birmingham doing things, DW doing certain
[00:33.280 --> 00:37.680]  things. New Orleans just based on where these addresses are and where the
[00:37.680 --> 00:41.680]  heat is shown that our members are and then reaching out and pulling them
[00:41.680 --> 00:46.920]  together for maybe monthly, five months and even quarterly events to keep that
[00:46.920 --> 00:54.000]  engagement going. It can become competitive and also lead up to you know our
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.920]  Black alumni weekend. For example, I think that if we had something to
[00:58.920 --> 01:04.080]  establish, I know for sure that I would be able to raise scholarship funds if it
[01:04.080 --> 01:08.440]  was competitive in nature on the outside between somebody like me and Shannon
[01:08.440 --> 01:13.680]  Shelby. So Shannon Shelby says he's over. He's now he's a social person. If he's
[01:13.680 --> 01:17.000]  saying he's hosting something that a whole thing is it look like we're competing
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.680]  but we're really not. We're raising money for the for the scholarship for the
[01:20.680 --> 01:25.200]  scholarship fund. On the outside, it looks like me versus him. But for the same
[01:25.200 --> 01:29.240]  purpose, it's over. Now we're taking it back to Jesuit days. It's an alpha versus
[01:29.240 --> 01:34.120]  capital. But this is really my partner, right? But with but although we're getting
[01:34.120 --> 01:38.520]  people linked in to this being a competitive thing, the overall end goal is
[01:38.520 --> 01:42.320]  that we're raising money for the scholarship. So I would be tasked with putting
[01:42.320 --> 01:47.720]  together my own event, right? And he might be doing his own event and it may be on
[01:47.760 --> 01:53.120]  the same day. But see we both know how to build up that that interest over time and
[01:53.120 --> 01:56.560]  see now when people see it the first time other people are going to want to
[01:56.560 --> 02:01.080]  join in the competition. I owe I'm in this city doing this. Me and the alumni from
[02:01.080 --> 02:05.200]  this city are doing this. You know, when if you're whether your event is
[02:05.200 --> 02:09.800]  winning or losing, the scholarship is winning because all of our money is going
[02:09.800 --> 02:13.600]  towards our scholarship, which is the big thing. So now when we're in the local
[02:13.600 --> 02:18.560]  community, we're still tied in. We still have something we want to go home to,
[02:18.560 --> 02:22.960]  but we're collectively building in so much money into the scholarship, which
[02:22.960 --> 02:29.120]  gives us social capital with Jesuit to be able to request more because we are
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.560]  giving more and we are participating more. Because Darren told me like, bro, our
[02:34.560 --> 02:39.160]  issue is that we don't go and participate in the things that matter to Jesuit.
[02:39.160 --> 02:43.080]  It's not always a matter of race. Sometimes it's a matter of money and what it is
[02:43.080 --> 02:48.000]  that you are bringing to the university for them to give you resources. We
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.400]  can't keep sitting here and when we do, not granted, we are contributors to
[02:52.400 --> 02:56.480]  the scholarship, but things have grown over time. But for Darren to say, I'm on a
[02:56.480 --> 03:00.960]  first-name basis with the university. I'm on a first-name basis with the
[03:00.960 --> 03:05.800]  president of school. He said, I can call and say, hey, don't, why everybody got
[03:05.800 --> 03:08.920]  security and we don't have security. He's like, I show up to the red tie
[03:08.960 --> 03:13.560]  functions and do that. He's like, you guys got to participate more in the official
[03:13.560 --> 03:18.360]  Jesuit things. He's like, it's not just the weekend. The Black alumni chapter
[03:18.360 --> 03:25.360]  itself has a long history that predates the 90s. It's in the 90s that this
[03:25.360 --> 03:28.800]  chapter was established. We don't put any honor to the history. We don't put any
[03:28.800 --> 03:32.960]  honor to the founders. A lot of people don't know that the Black alumni network
[03:32.960 --> 03:37.040]  is associated with the university. That the Black chapter, Black alumni chapter,
[03:37.040 --> 03:40.240]  is associated with the university. They don't understand the inner
[03:40.240 --> 03:45.120]  workings of how, hey, what we're doing is not just for a good time. What we're
[03:45.120 --> 03:50.400]  doing is for scholarship. The university is not against us. In the least the
[03:50.400 --> 03:54.080]  best. It's easy to assume that they don't want us to have anything or the DEI
[03:54.080 --> 04:00.560]  but they do not care that we need resources. We still have Black alumni
[04:00.560 --> 04:05.000]  weekend. We still was able to use the same name. They have not said, oh, we're
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.840]  trying to get rid of it, but they would like to see more than what we are
[04:08.840 --> 04:15.040]  doing. And no disrespect. Tyrone is not good at communicating that. Tyrone is
[04:15.040 --> 04:20.320]  not good at communicating at all. And so I love Jamaica, but there are certain
[04:20.320 --> 04:24.880]  things that Jamaica does not also understand as well. For example, I was saying,
[04:24.880 --> 04:30.760]  hey, we need to actually have a separate Black alumni weekend page from Black
[04:30.800 --> 04:37.000]  alumni network to disassociate that the Black alumni network only does the
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.720]  weekend because it's kind of hard. We have people that show up to this weekend
[04:41.720 --> 04:46.040]  who they graduate. We got people who just want to know about the party for us to
[04:46.040 --> 04:51.880]  be keep mixing the two or the pages only active when x, y, and z happens. It's
[04:51.880 --> 04:55.720]  an issue. She's not finished. I don't see why we should have two separate
[04:55.720 --> 05:00.000]  pages. Well, maybe because you don't understand marketing, you're not thinking
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.840]  from the customer perspective in working backwards. You're talking about what
[05:05.840 --> 05:10.640]  you will like. You are tapped into this. Align old and this is this for the young
[05:10.640 --> 05:17.160]  kids. No, there's only present. The only age is present today. There's some
[05:17.160 --> 05:23.440]  caveats to it. But today is the age. Today is old is the age. So if most people
[05:23.440 --> 05:28.720]  regardless of their age are going to this using these tools to get x, y, z and
[05:28.720 --> 05:33.280]  this age bracket is using these tools and this age bracket is using these tools.
[05:33.280 --> 05:37.960]  You cannot use this age brackets tools for this brackets tools. And it does not
[05:37.960 --> 05:42.800]  work like that. However, we need to look at where the most participation is and
[05:42.800 --> 05:51.280]  capitalize on that first and go from there. So you just gave a great caveat to what
[05:51.360 --> 05:59.680]  we can segue to understanding about what we have around the data that exists in
[05:59.680 --> 06:06.040]  order for us to be able to leverage what you've been able to explain. I asked the
[06:06.040 --> 06:14.680]  question, you know, what do we have currently as a data set, for example, with the
[06:14.680 --> 06:19.560]  Black Alumni Association or the Black Alumni Council to just see what we can do.
[06:19.800 --> 06:25.480]  So I think of like, do we have, you spoke about like addresses? Do we have addresses?
[06:25.480 --> 06:32.440]  If we have access, what access outside of addresses, do you think that we currently have
[06:32.440 --> 06:37.680]  that we may be able to full numbers? Okay. Addresses. Okay. And I think that may be
[06:37.680 --> 06:44.440]  enough in order for us to recognize like where we do have, is there anything that the
[06:44.440 --> 06:50.200]  Alumni Association is doing for those that come for us to recognize if they in fact
[06:50.200 --> 06:55.680]  are present for those that are current members. If that means like a check in for us to
[06:55.680 --> 07:02.480]  say, okay, that current alumni member was there for this weekend, 2025. So we can
[07:02.480 --> 07:08.960]  actually say, okay, we need to really say the gap exists for these areas versus those
[07:08.960 --> 07:16.320]  that don't come or those that do come, right? Like, what can we leverage to do that because
[07:16.320 --> 07:22.240]  I don't know what the end result or the product can be, but we at least know what data we have.
[07:22.240 --> 07:29.440]  I guess the KPIs based on how much money comes in the scholarship based on these sponsorships
[07:29.440 --> 07:38.440]  and tents that are purchased. Okay. What else? The attendance, but it's not like clocked.
[07:39.000 --> 07:46.600]  So there's a lot of stuff that we don't have. There's a lot of, we like to call scrappy information
[07:46.600 --> 07:54.200]  that we work with because some of these things are very simple concepts to me. What is going to make
[07:54.200 --> 08:06.680]  somebody come? I have argued with these names for over five years to put the homecoming in
[08:06.680 --> 08:16.040]  black alumni weekend on the same day. Why? Because when I would ask people why they wouldn't come,
[08:16.040 --> 08:21.240]  they would say it's black alumni weekend and I didn't graduate. So for the record, our
[08:21.240 --> 08:28.120]  fucking graduation rate and acceptance rate is a huge ass fucking disparity. The amount of people
[08:28.120 --> 08:34.360]  who graduate from Jacksonville versus people who quit, the people who quit is way larger, right?
[08:35.160 --> 08:39.400]  Anybody will come back to a homecoming because in order to come to a homecoming,
[08:39.400 --> 08:44.840]  all you had to do was attend. Graduation is not a requirement of attendance, but when you throw
[08:44.840 --> 08:52.760]  alumni in there, that just means graduation, right? So there's a segment where we was doing
[08:52.760 --> 08:58.840]  homecoming one weekend. We was doing black alumni another weekend. We have one black crowd and now
[08:58.920 --> 09:04.680]  we split it in half. In the day and age where optics are everything, okay? If this room only
[09:04.680 --> 09:10.440]  holds 100 people and we got 50 in and on this weekend and 50 on this weekend, it looks lame as
[09:10.440 --> 09:15.880]  fuck. But if we put all 100 in there and that 100 room, it looks pretty got them lit.
[09:15.880 --> 09:23.080]  And now we're creating a photo for people the previous year. So when you look at a marketing
[09:23.080 --> 09:31.720]  perspective, calling it, let's just say calling it black alumni weekend, ostracizes those
[09:31.720 --> 09:38.840]  that weren't alone. Which is why after so many fucking arguments, it's on the same weekend. So you
[09:38.840 --> 09:48.280]  will see JSU, black alumni weekend, line, homecoming. Now, so now you got the call to both parties.
[09:48.280 --> 09:55.320]  So we solved that problem. That's solved. But I had to fight back and forth with even with your
[09:55.320 --> 10:02.440]  ego, even with Tyrone and keep having to break it down to you guys are thinking about y'all.
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.080]  I am going to have conversations with people. Granted, one of the benefits of me being in Jacksonville
[10:09.080 --> 10:13.480]  and it's taken forever for me to get my fucking degree is knowing hella fucking people.
[10:13.480 --> 10:17.720]  And then living in the area and seeing people who were still in school after I graduated,
[10:17.720 --> 10:22.760]  to still have some kind of connection because they know my face. But to solicit their feedback
[10:22.760 --> 10:27.240]  and do something with it, I'm not making this about me, it's about the scholarship. So if you're
[10:27.240 --> 10:33.800]  telling me what puts money in the scholarship, attendance, address attendance, but makes you attend
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.560]  this or that, this make me feel good, this make me feel bad. Well, what if it was at the same
[10:37.560 --> 10:41.880]  down time? Well, shit, now I feel good because my guard is down and I could just see my friends and
[10:41.880 --> 10:48.440]  now it's nostalgic and it's fun and now we have a range of things. People are not thinking like that.
[10:48.440 --> 10:52.840]  I have to tell Tyrone, Jalisa, and it's on case of Jamega, that's my dog. Love what it does.
[10:53.400 --> 10:58.760]  We are not planning the event for us. We're gonna need to do whatever the fuck it is that we need
[10:58.760 --> 11:04.120]  to do to put the money in the scholarship because at the end of the day, we need this scholarship to
[11:04.120 --> 11:10.040]  help other black students get through fucking college. So let's go. So what haven't we solved?
[11:10.040 --> 11:15.960]  Now that we solved the problem of a homecoming in black alumni weekends, not being in the same
[11:18.280 --> 11:25.160]  date, but now they are. What haven't we solved? Streamline will want continuous engagement
[11:25.160 --> 11:32.200]  throughout the year before leading up like a couple months, right? Absolutely. Okay. We are not,
[11:32.200 --> 11:36.920]  we struggle with continuous engagement. If I'm not on the black alumni page, damn there ain't
[11:36.920 --> 11:43.080]  nobody, if nothing's happened. Like I got on what was it? 27, 10, or maybe I got to pass where it
[11:43.080 --> 11:48.280]  2021. I'm like, nigga, do you realize we got 300 fucking followers? Who the fuck was spent
[11:48.280 --> 11:55.000]  a concert at shit? Yeah. I'm like, nobody. Go and comment on people's another issue that we had.
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.800]  Was the hashtag JSU. That's Jacksonville State and that's Jackson State. So going on and I'm taking
[12:01.880 --> 12:08.760]  the time, me understanding how this works, clicking the hashtag, taking the time to go post through
[12:08.760 --> 12:17.880]  post, adding, commenting, graduates, that's fire, fire emojis, ooh, love it, tea, whatever, whatever,
[12:17.880 --> 12:24.040]  who I'm talking about in it, whatever to boost the engagement because that's what people value.
[12:24.040 --> 12:29.320]  Like, oh, people want to feel like, oh, this is my friend. Oh, that page lit. Like even when I
[12:29.320 --> 12:33.400]  respond to certain people through the page, like sometimes I might have to make a joke or whatever,
[12:33.400 --> 12:38.120]  whatever, like you can tell, like I got the joke side, I got to hate this to professional,
[12:38.120 --> 12:43.480]  but it's the engagement. Even when somebody brings the idea to me that I feel like it's trash,
[12:43.480 --> 12:48.760]  instead of saying no, or we can't do it, like I might let you talk all the way through it,
[12:48.760 --> 12:53.000]  but then also tell you like, this is what we need to do. This is what we need. But also letting
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.960]  you know that this, we are a university organization. This is not straight hustling. And we're not
[12:57.960 --> 13:03.080]  planning for 231. And then we do have to have approvals and that the university is not going to allow
[13:03.080 --> 13:08.520]  us to just slap JSU on anything, right? So that's the thing. So letting people know that,
[13:08.520 --> 13:14.760]  because fucking Kiera camera or key bus and whatever the fuck, the SG roll key. She said she didn't
[13:14.760 --> 13:18.440]  know that black alumni in that chapter was a part of the school. She just thought it was just
[13:18.440 --> 13:24.920]  on random black people pushing it together. Okay, but in another segment, when is it that we're
[13:24.920 --> 13:30.600]  putting out there less people know that that's not the case. Don't you see nothing's agency? But
[13:30.600 --> 13:39.240]  look at this. Granted, the black alumni chapter actually has a valuable history and notable
[13:39.240 --> 13:44.600]  members. And it was established in 1996. We literally should be able to do something with
[13:44.600 --> 13:51.240]  level of way of promoting and giving homage to that where that is like a part of the
[13:52.040 --> 13:57.960]  the site or the page is like, Hey, when you come here, this is the intro, like you should be able to
[13:57.960 --> 14:05.400]  to see this annually, like we're going to give you this again as it relates to this is why and who
[14:05.400 --> 14:12.920]  we are and how it became like that's something. But what else other than the one that I did that I
[14:12.920 --> 14:20.680]  had this shit fucking pissed me off because I thought I communicated this well. We needed a cycle
[14:20.760 --> 14:28.520]  of service. So for me, as somebody who's a part of black alumni chapter, black alumni network now,
[14:28.520 --> 14:32.360]  because the university has gone away from chapters, it just caught network. So it could be whatever
[14:32.360 --> 14:42.760]  whatever network. So I didn't know the black alumni network was a thing until 2021. That is fucking
[14:44.360 --> 14:48.600]  seven years I thought graduated from the university. However, this thing has been out
[14:49.560 --> 14:55.480]  damn near 20 years before I graduated, right? Why is it that I only knew about this
[14:56.440 --> 15:06.680]  until after I graduated years at an event? My thing is to create a cycle. Why not facilitate a future
[15:06.680 --> 15:16.200]  black alumni organization on campus so that there is a mental transition that when I joined in
[15:16.200 --> 15:23.240]  college, I am a future black alumni association member, whatever future black alumni network member.
[15:23.880 --> 15:31.720]  So when I move on and graduate, I understand that black alumni is a thing. It's indoctrinated
[15:31.720 --> 15:36.760]  and subconsciously planted in my mind to make me move forward. Which means that that same future
[15:36.760 --> 15:43.640]  black alumni organization on campus needs to engage with the current black alumni network to have
[15:44.360 --> 15:51.000]  partner the events of something to engage with the current what we see after what offer is
[15:52.040 --> 15:59.560]  in partnership to make it worthwhile that if we establish the organization and it has officers
[15:59.560 --> 16:08.040]  that they can get a scholarship for being a part of the executive body of the organization
[16:08.120 --> 16:15.240]  okay there is an incentive and we offer on the black alumni side networking and mentorship.
[16:15.240 --> 16:21.800]  When we have not done very well at all of the black alumni network is cultivation of leadership
[16:21.800 --> 16:27.640]  and mentors of people who actively want to do something and actually have these skills and
[16:27.640 --> 16:34.520]  criteria like skill, knowledge, wisdom and intent to want to do something valuable. Now I talk
[16:34.520 --> 16:40.520]  about equity here and I look at we look at executive members as being those leaders that's the
[16:40.520 --> 16:48.120]  upper deletion line now. There are those that may not want to be in leadership roles they'd like
[16:48.120 --> 16:55.640]  to be behind the scenes and all. What can we offer or what in the sense of for those that are
[16:55.640 --> 17:03.400]  non leadership members, what can the black alumni network offer those students as well as the
[17:03.400 --> 17:09.320]  executive students where they also feel developed, they also feel invested, they also feel that there
[17:09.320 --> 17:15.880]  is an incentive to join this organization and also continue after graduation and joined the
[17:15.880 --> 17:21.880]  black alumni network. We have to be able to find a bridge right in order for them to also feel
[17:21.880 --> 17:31.400]  there's a legacy to even deal. And on the alumni side I feel like that exists but when people are
[17:31.400 --> 17:38.360]  sending us retards it's kind of fucking hard. Okay so let's talk about what exists. What exists
[17:38.360 --> 17:43.880]  currently then? For them. A.K.S.I. not talking about shit. When we was in school Niggas was having
[17:43.880 --> 17:51.400]  a pledge classes 20, 30 plus now I see they're having four eight seven two one. What equity
[17:51.400 --> 17:57.400]  there exists now then with A.K.S.I. we didn't need none because I still don't see A.K.S.I doing
[17:57.400 --> 18:04.760]  nothing though we never needed none. We never needed A.K.S.I. okay but it wasn't it was something that
[18:04.760 --> 18:12.680]  was still beneficial. How? Because most people if you had joined A.K.S.I understand organizational
[18:12.680 --> 18:19.080]  structure and leadership to know that you play a part in it there's a upfront accountability system
[18:19.080 --> 18:25.640]  and an upfront process quote unquote. There's a there's a point A to point B. I hate to use a word
[18:25.640 --> 18:34.200]  process. When somebody tells me that they've been a part of a group that has an organizational
[18:34.200 --> 18:41.080]  structure it's not hard for me to believe that they can transition into the next organization
[18:41.080 --> 18:47.320]  because they understand there's fucking structure and things to be done if they've been on a committee
[18:47.320 --> 18:53.080]  whatever they know that this person says this I do this we do this you take a person that don't
[18:53.080 --> 18:58.760]  understand or know any of that shit then you try to put it in something like what we have
[18:59.480 --> 19:04.120]  it's not gonna work out. So I'm gonna tell you this from a management perspective now we're
[19:04.120 --> 19:10.840]  both in the careers and I will tell you this if you did not have your own boarding processes in
[19:10.840 --> 19:20.120]  place you're failing so if we as an organization do not have hey here is an intro to an organization
[19:20.120 --> 19:27.560]  structure framework and we know that that is imperative for someone that joins my organization
[19:27.560 --> 19:34.920]  our organization in order to be effective we should create a process or a training in order
[19:34.920 --> 19:41.160]  for them to understand what they do not have and we should not rely on a separate organization
[19:41.160 --> 19:46.680]  or the entity to be able to provide that because maybe that is not the path that they're going because
[19:46.680 --> 19:52.600]  I don't want think about it someone to join in auxiliary to join mine when we can provide the
[19:52.600 --> 19:59.640]  training for them directly look at this so what do we do let me hit you with this I agree with
[19:59.640 --> 20:05.320]  you a thousand percent but before you get the onboard niggas want to have a interview and know
[20:05.320 --> 20:10.520]  what your previous experience is before you can even get in the fucking door so on the same
[20:10.520 --> 20:15.080]  thing we're looking at previous experiences is it something we can work with it's very rare there
[20:15.080 --> 20:19.080]  are some people who was just motherfucking Michael Jordan of the trap where they can come in to
[20:19.080 --> 20:25.480]  assimilate and play and make that thing like but they'd be like you wasn't XYZ organized uh uh
[20:25.480 --> 20:31.400]  yeah not fuck no but I also still believe that even if we know that we in our interview that we
[20:31.400 --> 20:37.400]  have that available to be able to decipher or discern like okay they have the capability of your
[20:37.400 --> 20:44.440]  capacity if we still don't have something directly related to us we're still failed absolutely
[20:44.440 --> 20:49.720]  absolutely absolutely one and I think that even though you may have been in a case I you may
[20:49.720 --> 20:53.640]  have been in this year you may have been somewhere you've seen certain frameworks you've seen
[20:53.640 --> 21:01.080]  parliamentary procedure but I want you to go through with Zi Zi well whoever is doing because if you
[21:01.080 --> 21:07.800]  don't but we are failing because we're our expectation it's awful of something that is
[21:07.800 --> 21:14.280]  absolutely faux in fact right that even when you tie it into yeah I've been in a case I
[21:14.280 --> 21:18.840]  but nigga ain't never been to no meeting but we but okay but we that's crazy now I'm saying that's
[21:18.840 --> 21:24.920]  the truth I wasn't I wasn't I was in edge I was in a case I and since since I thought after
[21:24.920 --> 21:32.200]  on the court I never went to another meeting after you became after after I became an alpha but yeah
[21:32.280 --> 21:38.200]  that's cool but I will say this my line brother then and I promise you he don't know nothing about
[21:38.200 --> 21:45.800]  man I know what's not going to shit you asked that man what's the role of a vice president you
[21:45.800 --> 21:51.720]  wouldn't know I mean but it was so how do we be able to create a knowledge bank to be able to
[21:51.720 --> 21:57.480]  give somebody acumen around the smallest and intro level then tell you this bro and it's going
[21:57.480 --> 22:04.360]  to sound fucked up and I have this compositional cloud until we offer insert when it comes to
[22:04.360 --> 22:11.240]  leadership and influence not leadership too now you got to include them it's there by
[22:11.240 --> 22:15.000]  and large the majority of the organization come on now you can think about it they're the ones
[22:15.000 --> 22:23.560]  that actually pay for and keep operations open and run leadership yeah my leadership the
[22:23.560 --> 22:31.880]  organizations still have to remain exclusive for sure and it cannot that we don't things don't
[22:31.880 --> 22:37.560]  be vetted sometimes it'd be people like oh my god but we're we're wanting non-leaders to
[22:38.760 --> 22:47.720]  insert in capacities I don't like like I still feel like that non-leaders have to understand and
[22:47.720 --> 22:55.960]  know enough to know like okay this is what we supposed to do as non-leaders in our expectations
[22:55.960 --> 23:05.400]  with those leaders should be clear so nothing else what we have to do is realize and I think this
[23:05.400 --> 23:12.440]  ties back into like the black alumni stuff is like we have to recognize what we went from them
[23:12.520 --> 23:22.040]  and what they need from us and so what we can do with the data that we have with the black alumni
[23:22.040 --> 23:30.600]  network we can provide a compass for those that are assume leaders or those that volunteer as
[23:30.600 --> 23:37.080]  leaders to do something for the black alumni network in order to engage and connect and reclaim
[23:37.800 --> 23:45.240]  those that have not been to homecoming black alumni weekends et cetera especially for those
[23:45.240 --> 23:52.360]  that have not been contributed to any scholarship that we've had the thing is there the
[23:52.360 --> 23:58.600]  shouldn't be going on is that the people who want and so much out of our out of our black alumni
[23:58.600 --> 24:05.960]  network and contributed a fucking dime they don't know how anything fucking works not from a
[24:05.960 --> 24:13.880]  practical like not even the basic practical ship like even the other day I had a somebody
[24:13.880 --> 24:21.000]  message to page I entertain a conversation I entertain the conversation one because I don't
[24:21.000 --> 24:24.760]  want you to feel like if you speak to the network that you're going to get brushed off and nobody
[24:24.760 --> 24:30.520]  will hear you out right just like hey so what's your idea that I okay what are you wanting to do
[24:31.480 --> 24:37.080]  and till they get to the point in the conversation I say so are you wanting to facilitate this
[24:37.080 --> 24:44.840]  financial deal or were you expecting the black alumni network to finance this there's like oh I was
[24:44.840 --> 24:54.200]  just looking to you know how coordinate okay coach now what you said was not a bad way to
[24:54.200 --> 25:00.920]  respond to what I can recommend is how you deliver that message the way that I say that
[25:00.920 --> 25:04.920]  I want to let me let me let me let me read it so you know I'm just saying what the way that you
[25:04.920 --> 25:09.400]  said and everything that you have I like the context this is why I would have been able to respond
[25:09.400 --> 25:17.080]  to that instead I would have said I love the idea and what you been able to bring as I was doing
[25:17.080 --> 25:23.880]  my research I understand that there is some assume cost that we would have to incur that I want
[25:23.880 --> 25:31.320]  to know what is your ideas on how we can do this never says the first I need some older as
[25:32.440 --> 25:36.360]  HM and I'm like obviously you ain't plugged in with the goals because I'm never heard of you
[25:37.080 --> 25:42.520]  sends me to Vegas Greek picnic weekend okay he said hey I was thinking this event would be a
[25:42.520 --> 25:48.520]  great idea to continue to build the brother and sisterhood not only at JSU but also nationally
[25:48.600 --> 25:54.360]  I live in Vegas and I can assist in coordinating I said what's your idea of what it would look
[25:54.360 --> 26:00.040]  like for JSU it said we could set up accommodation and JSU holds an events at lounges or restaurants
[26:00.600 --> 26:05.800]  I said in Vegas or are you thinking about just hosting alumni events outside of the weekend in
[26:05.800 --> 26:12.040]  different places say yes while still having our annual event in JV I see this as an opportunity
[26:12.040 --> 26:18.360]  to continue to build on with it's already going well to JSU I am sure several alumni would be
[26:18.360 --> 26:25.480]  coming will be coming to Vegas so why not have the JSU hosted events to attend I said sounds
[26:25.480 --> 26:29.640]  like a good idea we're actually looking to try to have more events throughout the year aside from
[26:29.640 --> 26:35.240]  Black alumni weekend I will say that the biggest barrier is complaints from alumni and community
[26:35.240 --> 26:41.480]  members about cost it'll take some work but I don't think it's impossible he said exactly that's
[26:41.480 --> 26:46.760]  why I believe it's a great opportunity to piggyback off this Greek weekend in Vegas you don't
[26:46.760 --> 26:52.920]  need to sell Vegas to anyone because it sells itself however he's selling sales it's S-A-L-E-S
[26:54.120 --> 27:01.560]  I said oh you're saying to do it the same weekend as this Greek weekend he said yes just like you
[27:01.560 --> 27:06.520]  mentioned you're looking to do other events throughout the year and that weekend is perfect to host
[27:06.520 --> 27:13.400]  something I said do you have the average cost of a hotel in flight there for the weekend and what
[27:13.400 --> 27:19.880]  of this JSU Black alumni network would be hosting or supporting is this something that you will be
[27:19.880 --> 27:24.840]  facilitating financially or is this something that you're expecting the JSU Black alumni network to
[27:24.840 --> 27:31.080]  take care of no I was simply suggesting an offering to a system coordinate this how the fuck we
[27:31.080 --> 27:38.040]  don't have a whole event no one and no nothing I said understood we definitely have we definitely
[27:38.040 --> 27:43.400]  have to have a lot of that information up front to build an event like that I think it's a good idea
[27:43.400 --> 27:50.120]  it just has a lot of working pieces including university approval and funding he said as expected
[27:50.120 --> 27:54.840]  just give me a list of things you need to know in order to pull this off and I see what I can do
[27:54.840 --> 28:01.720]  this is your idea instead I just said so we would need a formal business proposal we would have
[28:01.720 --> 28:06.120]  to present this to the exec board and then the exec board have to present this to the university
[28:06.120 --> 28:12.680]  because we can't use JSU's name or trademarks without approval and we also need approval for the
[28:12.680 --> 28:18.520]  funding what I need is a clear overview of what you're proposing that includes the type of events
[28:18.520 --> 28:24.200]  the point of context responsible for planning the execution proposed dates and times and locations
[28:24.200 --> 28:31.880]  and a complete cost picture specifically estimated attendance itemized cost average hotels rate
[28:32.360 --> 28:39.800]  estimated airfare estimated income or revenue model hosts confirm photographer and videographer
[28:39.800 --> 28:46.040]  with cost and turnaround times the marketing plan venue policies and restrictions and other
[28:46.040 --> 28:53.160]  event insurance costs once that information is outlined we can evaluate feasibility and alignment
[28:53.160 --> 28:58.520]  and move forward accordingly this nigga said I'll see what I can put together and get back to you
[28:58.520 --> 29:03.880]  I said back sounds good big chance what the fuck you thought I was gonna do with a flyer nigga and
[29:03.880 --> 29:06.200]  the idea
