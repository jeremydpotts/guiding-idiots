1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Cool. However, our network is spread across America or Black Jesuit alumni. It

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,920
would help for engagement continuously if there were, if it were to kind of

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,480
like establish like chapters, maybe city chapters because it's already

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,440
everything. So we had Jesuit Black alumni and Atlanta hosting and having certain

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,280
events. But we had Jesuit alumni in Birmingham doing things, DW doing certain

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,680
things. New Orleans just based on where these addresses are and where the

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,680
heat is shown that our members are and then reaching out and pulling them

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,920
together for maybe monthly, five months and even quarterly events to keep that

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:54,000
engagement going. It can become competitive and also lead up to you know our

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,920
Black alumni weekend. For example, I think that if we had something to

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,080
establish, I know for sure that I would be able to raise scholarship funds if it

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,440
was competitive in nature on the outside between somebody like me and Shannon

13
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,680
Shelby. So Shannon Shelby says he's over. He's now he's a social person. If he's

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,000
saying he's hosting something that a whole thing is it look like we're competing

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,680
but we're really not. We're raising money for the for the scholarship for the

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,200
scholarship fund. On the outside, it looks like me versus him. But for the same

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,240
purpose, it's over. Now we're taking it back to Jesuit days. It's an alpha versus

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,120
capital. But this is really my partner, right? But with but although we're getting

19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,520
people linked in to this being a competitive thing, the overall end goal is

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,320
that we're raising money for the scholarship. So I would be tasked with putting

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,720
together my own event, right? And he might be doing his own event and it may be on

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,120
the same day. But see we both know how to build up that that interest over time and

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,560
see now when people see it the first time other people are going to want to

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,080
join in the competition. I owe I'm in this city doing this. Me and the alumni from

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,200
this city are doing this. You know, when if you're whether your event is

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,800
winning or losing, the scholarship is winning because all of our money is going

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,600
towards our scholarship, which is the big thing. So now when we're in the local

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,560
community, we're still tied in. We still have something we want to go home to,

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,960
but we're collectively building in so much money into the scholarship, which

30
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,120
gives us social capital with Jesuit to be able to request more because we are

31
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,560
giving more and we are participating more. Because Darren told me like, bro, our

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,160
issue is that we don't go and participate in the things that matter to Jesuit.

33
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,080
It's not always a matter of race. Sometimes it's a matter of money and what it is

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,000
that you are bringing to the university for them to give you resources. We

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,400
can't keep sitting here and when we do, not granted, we are contributors to

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,480
the scholarship, but things have grown over time. But for Darren to say, I'm on a

37
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,960
first-name basis with the university. I'm on a first-name basis with the

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,800
president of school. He said, I can call and say, hey, don't, why everybody got

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,920
security and we don't have security. He's like, I show up to the red tie

40
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,560
functions and do that. He's like, you guys got to participate more in the official

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,360
Jesuit things. He's like, it's not just the weekend. The Black alumni chapter

42
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,360
itself has a long history that predates the 90s. It's in the 90s that this

43
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,800
chapter was established. We don't put any honor to the history. We don't put any

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,960
honor to the founders. A lot of people don't know that the Black alumni network

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,040
is associated with the university. That the Black chapter, Black alumni chapter,

46
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,240
is associated with the university. They don't understand the inner

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,120
workings of how, hey, what we're doing is not just for a good time. What we're

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,400
doing is for scholarship. The university is not against us. In the least the

49
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,080
best. It's easy to assume that they don't want us to have anything or the DEI

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,560
but they do not care that we need resources. We still have Black alumni

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,000
weekend. We still was able to use the same name. They have not said, oh, we're

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,840
trying to get rid of it, but they would like to see more than what we are

53
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,040
doing. And no disrespect. Tyrone is not good at communicating that. Tyrone is

54
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,320
not good at communicating at all. And so I love Jamaica, but there are certain

55
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,880
things that Jamaica does not also understand as well. For example, I was saying,

56
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,760
hey, we need to actually have a separate Black alumni weekend page from Black

57
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,000
alumni network to disassociate that the Black alumni network only does the

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,720
weekend because it's kind of hard. We have people that show up to this weekend

59
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,040
who they graduate. We got people who just want to know about the party for us to

60
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,880
be keep mixing the two or the pages only active when x, y, and z happens. It's

61
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,720
an issue. She's not finished. I don't see why we should have two separate

62
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,000
pages. Well, maybe because you don't understand marketing, you're not thinking

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,840
from the customer perspective in working backwards. You're talking about what

64
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,640
you will like. You are tapped into this. Align old and this is this for the young

65
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,160
kids. No, there's only present. The only age is present today. There's some

66
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,440
caveats to it. But today is the age. Today is old is the age. So if most people

67
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,720
regardless of their age are going to this using these tools to get x, y, z and

68
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,280
this age bracket is using these tools and this age bracket is using these tools.

69
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,960
You cannot use this age brackets tools for this brackets tools. And it does not

70
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,800
work like that. However, we need to look at where the most participation is and

71
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:51,280
capitalize on that first and go from there. So you just gave a great caveat to what

72
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:59,680
we can segue to understanding about what we have around the data that exists in

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,040
order for us to be able to leverage what you've been able to explain. I asked the

74
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:14,680
question, you know, what do we have currently as a data set, for example, with the

75
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,560
Black Alumni Association or the Black Alumni Council to just see what we can do.

76
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,480
So I think of like, do we have, you spoke about like addresses? Do we have addresses?

77
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:32,440
If we have access, what access outside of addresses, do you think that we currently have

78
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,680
that we may be able to full numbers? Okay. Addresses. Okay. And I think that may be

79
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,440
enough in order for us to recognize like where we do have, is there anything that the

80
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,200
Alumni Association is doing for those that come for us to recognize if they in fact

81
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,680
are present for those that are current members. If that means like a check in for us to

82
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,480
say, okay, that current alumni member was there for this weekend, 2025. So we can

83
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,960
actually say, okay, we need to really say the gap exists for these areas versus those

84
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,320
that don't come or those that do come, right? Like, what can we leverage to do that because

85
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,240
I don't know what the end result or the product can be, but we at least know what data we have.

86
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:29,440
I guess the KPIs based on how much money comes in the scholarship based on these sponsorships

87
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:38,440
and tents that are purchased. Okay. What else? The attendance, but it's not like clocked.

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,600
So there's a lot of stuff that we don't have. There's a lot of, we like to call scrappy information

89
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:54,200
that we work with because some of these things are very simple concepts to me. What is going to make

90
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:06,680
somebody come? I have argued with these names for over five years to put the homecoming in

91
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:16,040
black alumni weekend on the same day. Why? Because when I would ask people why they wouldn't come,

92
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,240
they would say it's black alumni weekend and I didn't graduate. So for the record, our

93
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:28,120
fucking graduation rate and acceptance rate is a huge ass fucking disparity. The amount of people

94
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,360
who graduate from Jacksonville versus people who quit, the people who quit is way larger, right?

95
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,400
Anybody will come back to a homecoming because in order to come to a homecoming,

96
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,840
all you had to do was attend. Graduation is not a requirement of attendance, but when you throw

97
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:52,760
alumni in there, that just means graduation, right? So there's a segment where we was doing

98
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,840
homecoming one weekend. We was doing black alumni another weekend. We have one black crowd and now

99
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,680
we split it in half. In the day and age where optics are everything, okay? If this room only

100
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,440
holds 100 people and we got 50 in and on this weekend and 50 on this weekend, it looks lame as

101
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,880
fuck. But if we put all 100 in there and that 100 room, it looks pretty got them lit.

102
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:23,080
And now we're creating a photo for people the previous year. So when you look at a marketing

103
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:31,720
perspective, calling it, let's just say calling it black alumni weekend, ostracizes those

104
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:38,840
that weren't alone. Which is why after so many fucking arguments, it's on the same weekend. So you

105
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:48,280
will see JSU, black alumni weekend, line, homecoming. Now, so now you got the call to both parties.

106
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:55,320
So we solved that problem. That's solved. But I had to fight back and forth with even with your

107
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:02,440
ego, even with Tyrone and keep having to break it down to you guys are thinking about y'all.

108
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,080
I am going to have conversations with people. Granted, one of the benefits of me being in Jacksonville

109
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,480
and it's taken forever for me to get my fucking degree is knowing hella fucking people.

110
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,720
And then living in the area and seeing people who were still in school after I graduated,

111
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,760
to still have some kind of connection because they know my face. But to solicit their feedback

112
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,240
and do something with it, I'm not making this about me, it's about the scholarship. So if you're

113
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,800
telling me what puts money in the scholarship, attendance, address attendance, but makes you attend

114
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,560
this or that, this make me feel good, this make me feel bad. Well, what if it was at the same

115
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,880
down time? Well, shit, now I feel good because my guard is down and I could just see my friends and

116
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:48,440
now it's nostalgic and it's fun and now we have a range of things. People are not thinking like that.

117
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,840
I have to tell Tyrone, Jalisa, and it's on case of Jamega, that's my dog. Love what it does.

118
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,760
We are not planning the event for us. We're gonna need to do whatever the fuck it is that we need

119
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,120
to do to put the money in the scholarship because at the end of the day, we need this scholarship to

120
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:10,040
help other black students get through fucking college. So let's go. So what haven't we solved?

121
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,960
Now that we solved the problem of a homecoming in black alumni weekends, not being in the same

122
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:25,160
date, but now they are. What haven't we solved? Streamline will want continuous engagement

123
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:32,200
throughout the year before leading up like a couple months, right? Absolutely. Okay. We are not,

124
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,920
we struggle with continuous engagement. If I'm not on the black alumni page, damn there ain't

125
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,080
nobody, if nothing's happened. Like I got on what was it? 27, 10, or maybe I got to pass where it

126
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,280
2021. I'm like, nigga, do you realize we got 300 fucking followers? Who the fuck was spent

127
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:55,000
a concert at shit? Yeah. I'm like, nobody. Go and comment on people's another issue that we had.

128
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,800
Was the hashtag JSU. That's Jacksonville State and that's Jackson State. So going on and I'm taking

129
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,760
the time, me understanding how this works, clicking the hashtag, taking the time to go post through

130
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:17,880
post, adding, commenting, graduates, that's fire, fire emojis, ooh, love it, tea, whatever, whatever,

131
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:24,040
who I'm talking about in it, whatever to boost the engagement because that's what people value.

132
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,320
Like, oh, people want to feel like, oh, this is my friend. Oh, that page lit. Like even when I

133
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,400
respond to certain people through the page, like sometimes I might have to make a joke or whatever,

134
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,120
whatever, like you can tell, like I got the joke side, I got to hate this to professional,

135
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,480
but it's the engagement. Even when somebody brings the idea to me that I feel like it's trash,

136
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,760
instead of saying no, or we can't do it, like I might let you talk all the way through it,

137
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,000
but then also tell you like, this is what we need to do. This is what we need. But also letting

138
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,960
you know that this, we are a university organization. This is not straight hustling. And we're not

139
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,080
planning for 231. And then we do have to have approvals and that the university is not going to allow

140
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:08,520
us to just slap JSU on anything, right? So that's the thing. So letting people know that,

141
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:14,760
because fucking Kiera camera or key bus and whatever the fuck, the SG roll key. She said she didn't

142
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,440
know that black alumni in that chapter was a part of the school. She just thought it was just

143
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,920
on random black people pushing it together. Okay, but in another segment, when is it that we're

144
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,600
putting out there less people know that that's not the case. Don't you see nothing's agency? But

145
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:39,240
look at this. Granted, the black alumni chapter actually has a valuable history and notable

146
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,600
members. And it was established in 1996. We literally should be able to do something with

147
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,240
level of way of promoting and giving homage to that where that is like a part of the

148
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,960
the site or the page is like, Hey, when you come here, this is the intro, like you should be able to

149
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:05,400
to see this annually, like we're going to give you this again as it relates to this is why and who

150
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:12,920
we are and how it became like that's something. But what else other than the one that I did that I

151
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:20,680
had this shit fucking pissed me off because I thought I communicated this well. We needed a cycle

152
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:28,520
of service. So for me, as somebody who's a part of black alumni chapter, black alumni network now,

153
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,360
because the university has gone away from chapters, it just caught network. So it could be whatever

154
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:42,760
whatever network. So I didn't know the black alumni network was a thing until 2021. That is fucking

155
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,600
seven years I thought graduated from the university. However, this thing has been out

156
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,480
damn near 20 years before I graduated, right? Why is it that I only knew about this

157
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:06,680
until after I graduated years at an event? My thing is to create a cycle. Why not facilitate a future

158
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:16,200
black alumni organization on campus so that there is a mental transition that when I joined in

159
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:23,240
college, I am a future black alumni association member, whatever future black alumni network member.

160
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:31,720
So when I move on and graduate, I understand that black alumni is a thing. It's indoctrinated

161
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,760
and subconsciously planted in my mind to make me move forward. Which means that that same future

162
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:43,640
black alumni organization on campus needs to engage with the current black alumni network to have

163
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:51,000
partner the events of something to engage with the current what we see after what offer is

164
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:59,560
in partnership to make it worthwhile that if we establish the organization and it has officers

165
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:08,040
that they can get a scholarship for being a part of the executive body of the organization

166
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:15,240
okay there is an incentive and we offer on the black alumni side networking and mentorship.

167
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,800
When we have not done very well at all of the black alumni network is cultivation of leadership

168
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,640
and mentors of people who actively want to do something and actually have these skills and

169
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:34,520
criteria like skill, knowledge, wisdom and intent to want to do something valuable. Now I talk

170
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:40,520
about equity here and I look at we look at executive members as being those leaders that's the

171
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:48,120
upper deletion line now. There are those that may not want to be in leadership roles they'd like

172
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:55,640
to be behind the scenes and all. What can we offer or what in the sense of for those that are

173
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:03,400
non leadership members, what can the black alumni network offer those students as well as the

174
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:09,320
executive students where they also feel developed, they also feel invested, they also feel that there

175
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:15,880
is an incentive to join this organization and also continue after graduation and joined the

176
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,880
black alumni network. We have to be able to find a bridge right in order for them to also feel

177
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:31,400
there's a legacy to even deal. And on the alumni side I feel like that exists but when people are

178
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:38,360
sending us retards it's kind of fucking hard. Okay so let's talk about what exists. What exists

179
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,880
currently then? For them. A.K.S.I. not talking about shit. When we was in school Niggas was having

180
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:51,400
a pledge classes 20, 30 plus now I see they're having four eight seven two one. What equity

181
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,400
there exists now then with A.K.S.I. we didn't need none because I still don't see A.K.S.I doing

182
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,760
nothing though we never needed none. We never needed A.K.S.I. okay but it wasn't it was something that

183
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:12,680
was still beneficial. How? Because most people if you had joined A.K.S.I understand organizational

184
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:19,080
structure and leadership to know that you play a part in it there's a upfront accountability system

185
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:25,640
and an upfront process quote unquote. There's a there's a point A to point B. I hate to use a word

186
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:34,200
process. When somebody tells me that they've been a part of a group that has an organizational

187
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:41,080
structure it's not hard for me to believe that they can transition into the next organization

188
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:47,320
because they understand there's fucking structure and things to be done if they've been on a committee

189
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:53,080
whatever they know that this person says this I do this we do this you take a person that don't

190
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,760
understand or know any of that shit then you try to put it in something like what we have

191
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,120
it's not gonna work out. So I'm gonna tell you this from a management perspective now we're

192
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,840
both in the careers and I will tell you this if you did not have your own boarding processes in

193
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:20,120
place you're failing so if we as an organization do not have hey here is an intro to an organization

194
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:27,560
structure framework and we know that that is imperative for someone that joins my organization

195
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:34,920
our organization in order to be effective we should create a process or a training in order

196
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:41,160
for them to understand what they do not have and we should not rely on a separate organization

197
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,680
or the entity to be able to provide that because maybe that is not the path that they're going because

198
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:52,600
I don't want think about it someone to join in auxiliary to join mine when we can provide the

199
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:59,640
training for them directly look at this so what do we do let me hit you with this I agree with

200
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,320
you a thousand percent but before you get the onboard niggas want to have a interview and know

201
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,520
what your previous experience is before you can even get in the fucking door so on the same

202
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,080
thing we're looking at previous experiences is it something we can work with it's very rare there

203
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,080
are some people who was just motherfucking Michael Jordan of the trap where they can come in to

204
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:25,480
assimilate and play and make that thing like but they'd be like you wasn't XYZ organized uh uh

205
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,400
yeah not fuck no but I also still believe that even if we know that we in our interview that we

206
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,400
have that available to be able to decipher or discern like okay they have the capability of your

207
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,440
capacity if we still don't have something directly related to us we're still failed absolutely

208
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,720
absolutely absolutely one and I think that even though you may have been in a case I you may

209
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,640
have been in this year you may have been somewhere you've seen certain frameworks you've seen

210
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:01,080
parliamentary procedure but I want you to go through with Zi Zi well whoever is doing because if you

211
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:07,800
don't but we are failing because we're our expectation it's awful of something that is

212
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:14,280
absolutely faux in fact right that even when you tie it into yeah I've been in a case I

213
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,840
but nigga ain't never been to no meeting but we but okay but we that's crazy now I'm saying that's

214
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,920
the truth I wasn't I wasn't I was in edge I was in a case I and since since I thought after

215
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:32,200
on the court I never went to another meeting after you became after after I became an alpha but yeah

216
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,200
that's cool but I will say this my line brother then and I promise you he don't know nothing about

217
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:45,800
man I know what's not going to shit you asked that man what's the role of a vice president you

218
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:51,720
wouldn't know I mean but it was so how do we be able to create a knowledge bank to be able to

219
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,480
give somebody acumen around the smallest and intro level then tell you this bro and it's going

220
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:04,360
to sound fucked up and I have this compositional cloud until we offer insert when it comes to

221
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:11,240
leadership and influence not leadership too now you got to include them it's there by

222
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,000
and large the majority of the organization come on now you can think about it they're the ones

223
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,560
that actually pay for and keep operations open and run leadership yeah my leadership the

224
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:31,880
organizations still have to remain exclusive for sure and it cannot that we don't things don't

225
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,560
be vetted sometimes it'd be people like oh my god but we're we're wanting non-leaders to

226
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:47,720
insert in capacities I don't like like I still feel like that non-leaders have to understand and

227
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:55,960
know enough to know like okay this is what we supposed to do as non-leaders in our expectations

228
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:05,400
with those leaders should be clear so nothing else what we have to do is realize and I think this

229
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:12,440
ties back into like the black alumni stuff is like we have to recognize what we went from them

230
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:22,040
and what they need from us and so what we can do with the data that we have with the black alumni

231
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:30,600
network we can provide a compass for those that are assume leaders or those that volunteer as

232
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:37,080
leaders to do something for the black alumni network in order to engage and connect and reclaim

233
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:45,240
those that have not been to homecoming black alumni weekends et cetera especially for those

234
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:52,360
that have not been contributed to any scholarship that we've had the thing is there the

235
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:58,600
shouldn't be going on is that the people who want and so much out of our out of our black alumni

236
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,960
network and contributed a fucking dime they don't know how anything fucking works not from a

237
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:13,880
practical like not even the basic practical ship like even the other day I had a somebody

238
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:21,000
message to page I entertain a conversation I entertain the conversation one because I don't

239
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,760
want you to feel like if you speak to the network that you're going to get brushed off and nobody

240
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:30,520
will hear you out right just like hey so what's your idea that I okay what are you wanting to do

241
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,080
and till they get to the point in the conversation I say so are you wanting to facilitate this

242
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:44,840
financial deal or were you expecting the black alumni network to finance this there's like oh I was

243
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:54,200
just looking to you know how coordinate okay coach now what you said was not a bad way to

244
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:00,920
respond to what I can recommend is how you deliver that message the way that I say that

245
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,920
I want to let me let me let me let me read it so you know I'm just saying what the way that you

246
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,400
said and everything that you have I like the context this is why I would have been able to respond

247
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:17,080
to that instead I would have said I love the idea and what you been able to bring as I was doing

248
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:23,880
my research I understand that there is some assume cost that we would have to incur that I want

249
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:31,320
to know what is your ideas on how we can do this never says the first I need some older as

250
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,360
HM and I'm like obviously you ain't plugged in with the goals because I'm never heard of you

251
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,520
sends me to Vegas Greek picnic weekend okay he said hey I was thinking this event would be a

252
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,520
great idea to continue to build the brother and sisterhood not only at JSU but also nationally

253
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,360
I live in Vegas and I can assist in coordinating I said what's your idea of what it would look

254
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,040
like for JSU it said we could set up accommodation and JSU holds an events at lounges or restaurants

255
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,800
I said in Vegas or are you thinking about just hosting alumni events outside of the weekend in

256
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:12,040
different places say yes while still having our annual event in JV I see this as an opportunity

257
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:18,360
to continue to build on with it's already going well to JSU I am sure several alumni would be

258
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:25,480
coming will be coming to Vegas so why not have the JSU hosted events to attend I said sounds

259
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,640
like a good idea we're actually looking to try to have more events throughout the year aside from

260
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,240
Black alumni weekend I will say that the biggest barrier is complaints from alumni and community

261
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:41,480
members about cost it'll take some work but I don't think it's impossible he said exactly that's

262
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,760
why I believe it's a great opportunity to piggyback off this Greek weekend in Vegas you don't

263
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,920
need to sell Vegas to anyone because it sells itself however he's selling sales it's S-A-L-E-S

264
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:01,560
I said oh you're saying to do it the same weekend as this Greek weekend he said yes just like you

265
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:06,520
mentioned you're looking to do other events throughout the year and that weekend is perfect to host

266
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:13,400
something I said do you have the average cost of a hotel in flight there for the weekend and what

267
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,880
of this JSU Black alumni network would be hosting or supporting is this something that you will be

268
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,840
facilitating financially or is this something that you're expecting the JSU Black alumni network to

269
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:31,080
take care of no I was simply suggesting an offering to a system coordinate this how the fuck we

270
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:38,040
don't have a whole event no one and no nothing I said understood we definitely have we definitely

271
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:43,400
have to have a lot of that information up front to build an event like that I think it's a good idea

272
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:50,120
it just has a lot of working pieces including university approval and funding he said as expected

273
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,840
just give me a list of things you need to know in order to pull this off and I see what I can do

274
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:01,720
this is your idea instead I just said so we would need a formal business proposal we would have

275
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,120
to present this to the exec board and then the exec board have to present this to the university

276
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:12,680
because we can't use JSU's name or trademarks without approval and we also need approval for the

277
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:18,520
funding what I need is a clear overview of what you're proposing that includes the type of events

278
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:24,200
the point of context responsible for planning the execution proposed dates and times and locations

279
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:31,880
and a complete cost picture specifically estimated attendance itemized cost average hotels rate

280
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:39,800
estimated airfare estimated income or revenue model hosts confirm photographer and videographer

281
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:46,040
with cost and turnaround times the marketing plan venue policies and restrictions and other

282
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:53,160
event insurance costs once that information is outlined we can evaluate feasibility and alignment

283
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,520
and move forward accordingly this nigga said I'll see what I can put together and get back to you

284
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,880
I said back sounds good big chance what the fuck you thought I was gonna do with a flyer nigga and

285
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,200
the idea
